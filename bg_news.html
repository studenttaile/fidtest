<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>posted by BGB, <time datetime="2016-15-11">November 15, 2016</time></p>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>


<p>Location:<br>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
<p>Hours:<br> Tuesday to Saturday, <time datetime="11:00">11am</time> to <time datetime="23:00"> 11pm</time></p>
