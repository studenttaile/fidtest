        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i>Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
